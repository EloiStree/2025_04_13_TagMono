A simple toolbox for quickly creating Tag scripts in Unity3D.

In many projects, I often need a way to tag objects so they can be easily found.  
Usually, I also want these tags to be accessible via a static collection to track what's in the scene and which objects are active.

This Git repo provides a generic static class you can inherit from to achieve exactly that.
